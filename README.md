# Deadwood

Deadwood is my implementation of the popular board game "Deadwood Studios" by CheapAss games.

The game is a 2-8 player game in which each person is a motivated actor trying to make it big in hollywood. Each player naviagtes through
this hollywood movie backlot trying to earn the most cash or credit before time is up.
